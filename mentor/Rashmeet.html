      <h2>Rashmeet Kaur</h2>
      <p class="mentor-role">Mentor | Operations & Communications</p>

      <p class="mentor-bio">
        I am a B.Com (Hons) student at <strong>Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce, University of Delhi</strong>, passionate about 
        growth, communication, and creating impact through structured initiatives. 
        Having worked across <strong>operations, public relations, and leadership roles</strong>, Iâ€™ve developed a deep interest in 
        building meaningful collaborations and empowering others to reach their potential.
      </p>

      <p class="mentor-reason">
        I wanted to take up the role of a mentor because I genuinely enjoy being a student again. 
        Having recently gone through similar experiences, I understand the mix of excitement and confusion that comes with it. 
        Mentoring, for me, is a two-way journey â€” while I share insights and guidance, I also learn from the fresh perspectives 
        and ideas of students.
