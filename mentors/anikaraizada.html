    <h2>Hi! I'm Anika</h2>
    <p
      I'm currently finishing my first year studying Economics at UCL. While academic achievement (I scored 44 IB points) certainly opened doors for me, universiy life taught me so much-more like making weird pasta dishes (but butter-chicken pasta, anyone?).From living solo, navigating societies, to learning when and how to ask for help... university itself was the greatest classroom.

    <h3>The real university experience includes:</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>Figuring things out on the fly</li>
      <li>Joining societies and meeting new people</li>
      <li>Getting lost (a few times)</li>
      <li>Cooking creative comfort food</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="mentor-support">
    <h3>Support Systems I've Navigated:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mental health & wellbeing resources</li>
      <li>Academic accommodations & planning</li>
      <li>Campus services—figuring out where to go when</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you're curious about how all these actually work—not just from a website but the real behind-the-scenes—happy to chat!
